# Phase 4: AI gateway plane (Module 2, budget 25 min)

**Goal:** The AI gateway plane installed and the AI-plane policies defined in audit mode, so the AI plane is governed from birth.

**Inputs:** Module 1 complete (a working IDP). Gateway API CRDs are a prerequisite for the gateways.

**Outputs:**
- Gateway API standard CRDs (v1.5.1) applied with server-side apply
- kgateway (v2.3.4) installed from its OCI charts (kgateway-crds then kgateway) into kgateway-system
- agentgateway (v1.3.0) installed from its own native OCI charts (agentgateway-crds then agentgateway) into agentgateway-system, with mTLS and audit logging on
- The AI-plane Kyverno policies defined in audit mode: require an LLM Guard policy reference on agents, image allowlist for AI namespaces, require OTel annotations, deny agent-namespace egress to LLM endpoints that bypass agentgateway

**Test criteria (tests/test_phase_4_ai_gateway.py):**
- Gateway API CRDs are established at v1 (GatewayClass, Gateway, HTTPRoute)
- kgateway and agentgateway pods are Ready in their namespaces
- A Gateway resource reconciles and is programmed
- The AI-plane Kyverno policies exist in Audit mode (not Enforce) and report, not block

**Completion promise:** `<promise>PHASE4_DONE</promise>`

**Key decisions:**
- agentgateway is a Linux Foundation / Agentic AI Foundation project, not CNCF, and a sibling of kgateway, not its data plane. Install agentgateway from its native charts (cr.agentgateway.dev), not the legacy kgateway-hosted 2.x charts.
- kgateway is CNCF Sandbox; its CRDs are `gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1`. Lock to the stable patch, no alpha.
- Pick one owner for the Gateway API CRDs (the upstream manifest or a controller), not both.
- Policies start in Audit so the AI plane lands governed; Phase 8 flips them to Enforce.

**Stop here.** Output the completion promise and wait. The presenter shows the routing config that mediates LLM, MCP, and A2A traffic, and the audit-mode policies already watching.
