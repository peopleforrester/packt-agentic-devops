# ABOUTME: Contract tests for a generated agent service. Runs offline, before the cluster.
# ABOUTME: Asserts names line up, labels and required controls survived, no placeholder escaped.
"""Local contract tests for this generated agent service.

These run against the files in this repository, with no cluster and no network, so a
developer can prove the golden path produced a governed service before ArgoCD has
reconciled anything.

Run them with:

    uv run --with pytest --with pyyaml python -m pytest -q tests/test_contract.py

Note on the placeholder check: the Backstage scaffolder renders every file in the
skeleton through nunjucks, so this file must never contain a literal opening delimiter.
The pattern below is built from an escaped regex for exactly that reason. Do not
"simplify" it into a plain string, or scaffolding will consume it and the check will
silently pass on every repository.
