# Backstage image

The workshop Backstage image is built ahead of time and pushed to GHCR, then the
`backstage` Helm release runs it. Backstage is a framework: you scaffold an app, add
plugins, and build. This directory holds the overlay and the build automation, not the
generated app (which `create-app` produces and which is gitignored).

## What is here

- `Dockerfile` — the create-app host-build image (Node 24-trixie-slim). Copied into the
  scaffolded app by the build script.
- `app-config.production.yaml` — production config: in-cluster Gitea integration, the
  ArgoCD proxy and plugin config, TechDocs, catalog, guest auth. Secrets and hosts come
  from env vars injected by the Helm release, never hardcoded.
- `overlay/packages/backend/src/index.ts` — backend wiring: the standard new-backend
  system plus `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend-module-gitea`.
- `build-and-push.sh` — scaffolds (once), adds plugins, applies the overlay, builds the
  bundle, builds and pushes `ghcr.io/$GHCR_ORG/backstage:$TAG`.

## Build

```bash
GHCR_ORG=<org> TAG=2026-07-23 ./build-and-push.sh
```

The generated app lands in `backstage-app/` (gitignored). Delete it to rescaffold.

## Runtime config (Helm release)

The `backstage` Application injects these as env vars (from the `gitea-scm-token` Secret
and ArgoCD service account):

- `BACKSTAGE_BASE_URL`
- `GITEA_HOST`, `GITEA_USERNAME`, `GITEA_TOKEN`
- `ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN`

Point the release's `image.repository` at `ghcr.io/$GHCR_ORG/backstage` and `image.tag`
at the built tag.

## Manual step: ArgoCD frontend wiring

The Gitea scaffolder actions are wired in the backend overlay and work headless. The
ArgoCD plugin is a frontend plugin: after scaffolding, add its card or tab to
`packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx` per the plugin README. The proxy and
`argocd` config blocks it needs are already in `app-config.production.yaml`.

## Version note

`CREATE_APP_VERSION` defaults to `latest`. Pin it to the create-app release that ships
the Backstage line in `versions.lock.md` (1.51.x) for a reproducible build, and verify
the backend `index.ts` import set against that version before the freeze.
