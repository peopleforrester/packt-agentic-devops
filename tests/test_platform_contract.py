# ABOUTME: Contract tests for the platform manifests, covering the defect classes that recur here.
# ABOUTME: Each one is a mistake this repo actually shipped, not a hypothetical.
#
# The recurring classes, every one of which has cost real debugging time:
#
#   1. An unsubstituted REPLACE_WITH_* placeholder, which leaves an Application Degraded forever.
#   2. runAsNonRoot with no numeric runAsUser on an image whose USER is not numeric, which the
#      kubelet refuses with CreateContainerConfigError before the container starts.
#   3. An image repository that repeats the registry host, producing a doubled path.
#   4. A helper image override that no longer resolves.
#   5. A dynamically provisioned volume with no ownership tag, which survives a teardown.
#
# These need no cluster and no cloud account. Each assertion is a failure someone already paid for
# on a live one.
#
# These run without AWS on purpose. Every assertion here is a failure someone already paid for on a
# live cluster, and at fleet scale each one would repeat across 250 clusters in five accounts.
