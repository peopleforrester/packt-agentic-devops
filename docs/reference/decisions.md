# Decisions

Locked decisions for the Packt workshop. Newest at the bottom. These are the source of truth when the build spec and reality disagree.

Change control: the architecture is locked. Before changing any decision here or in `docs/architecture.md`, read the current state first and understand why it is what it is. A change lands as a new numbered entry that names and supersedes the prior one, with the date and the reason. Never silently overwrite a settled decision.

## D1. Backbone: Amazon EKS, one cluster per student

EKS, one cluster per student, provisioned live. Managed control plane plus a T3 node group. vcluster is not used. Kubernetes 1.35. (June 17, 2026)

## D2. Component set is not a target number

Build the right set of IDP components. The count is whatever it adds up to. CI checks that every entry is version-pinned, not that there are N of them. (June 17, 2026)

## D3. vLLM stays on T3

The in-cluster model runs on t3.2xlarge with the model pre-warmed and a pre-warmed-request fallback. T3 is the last Intel x86 burstable family; the vLLM CPU image is x86. No dedicated compute node. (June 17, 2026)

## D4. Attendee cluster TTL

Warm before 11:00 AM EDT, torn down about 2 hours after close. No take-home persistence; the repo is the take-home. (June 17, 2026)

## D5. Demo agent model routing

Attendee clusters route the in-cluster agents to the in-cluster vLLM over an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. No external API spend, no external credentials. (June 18, 2026)

## D6. Live build scope: bare cluster, students build everything

The only thing pre-staged is a bare cluster, up, with credentials handed to the student at the start. ArgoCD is not installed, the repo is not cloned, nothing is synced. The student's own agentic CLI, driven by the spec document, builds everything from Phase 0, including installing ArgoCD and cloning the repo. Precedent: at KCD Texas, students completed the full build in about 20 minutes of a 90-minute session. Nothing is compiled from source live; the build deploys pre-built images via GitOps, which is why it is fast. (June 19, 2026)

## D7. Pacing: the spec forces stops between phases

The spec document forces a stop between each phase. The presenter presents during the stops, and everyone resumes together. This is the sync mechanism; it does not depend on lockstep enforcement beyond the spec gates. Holds at the workshop's audience scale. (June 19, 2026)

## D8. Phase structure

Roughly nine phases, Phase 0 through Phase 8, mapping the abstract's three modules plus the wrap onto phases. The presenter proposes the breakdown in the attendee spec; Michael signs off. (June 19, 2026)

## D9. Cluster provisioning is Michael's

Michael provisions all 300 clusters, including the t3.2xlarge sizing and the per-cluster in-cluster vLLM. This is out of the build scope here. Each cluster runs its own small in-cluster vLLM, which is the simulated inference; no student gets access to a large external LLM. (June 19, 2026)

## D10. Prerequisite: bring your own agentic CLI

Students bring their own paid agentic coding CLI plan, Claude Code or an equivalent. The workshop does not provide it. The tool must be able to register and run inside the remote cluster system the student is given. (June 19, 2026)

## D11. AI-plane policies precede the AI plane

The AI-plane Kyverno policies are defined in audit mode in Phase 4, as the AI gateway plane lands, so kagent and agentgateway are governed from birth. Phase 8 flips them from audit to enforce and runs the live denial demo. Governance precedes the workload. (June 19, 2026)

## D13. Accepted agentic CLIs; the two LLM roles are distinct

Per-vendor spikes (June 19, 2026) verified which CLIs actually work for the workshop (headless in the remote shell, governed gate, lifecycle hooks for audit). Working set:

- Claude Code (primary): paid plan, OpenAI-compatible base URL works, PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks.
- OpenAI Codex CLI: paid, GA hooks.
- GitHub Copilot CLI (the new agentic `copilot`, GA Feb 2026): paid Copilot tier, governed default, preToolUse/postToolUse hooks. Not the old suggest-only `gh copilot`.
- Google Antigravity CLI (GA May 2026): free Individual preview, governed via Terminal Execution Policy Off, Inspect hooks. This is Google's successor; Gemini CLI itself goes dark for free/Pro/Ultra plans June 18, 2026.
- Amazon Kiro CLI 2.0 (GA April 2026): free tier includes the CLI, governed via `--trust-tools`, pre/post hooks. This is AWS's successor; Amazon Q Developer CLI signups are blocked from May 15, 2026.
- opencode (MIT, free): BYO-key, points at the in-cluster vLLM directly, governed and audited via the `tool.execute.before/after` plugin (native interactive ask hangs headless).
- Goose (Apache-2.0, free): BYO-key, points at the in-cluster vLLM, governed and audited via the PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks engine (not GOOSE_MODE).
- Cursor CLI: works headless with hook-based governance, but locked to Cursor's hosted models (no in-cluster vLLM) and beta safeguards. Weakest fit.

Name the dead products explicitly so students do not bring them: Gemini CLI (use Antigravity), Amazon Q Developer CLI (use Kiro). Free and open-source options for students without a paid plan: opencode and Goose, both vLLM-ready.

Two LLM roles, not to be confused: the agentic CLI is the builder and runs on the student's own model (their plan, their spend, by design, or the in-cluster vLLM if they use opencode/Goose). The model the deployed platform agents call is the small in-cluster vLLM, with no external spend. The no-external-spend rule applies to the deployed demo agent, not to the student's build CLI. (June 19, 2026)

## D14. RESOLVED: per-agent attribution works across the modern agentic CLIs

The earlier claim that the B17 attribution beat works cleanly only on Claude Code and Codex was wrong, corrected by the per-vendor spikes. Every CLI in the D13 working set now ships lifecycle hooks suitable for a per-action audit trail: Claude Code (PreToolUse/PostToolUse), Codex (GA hooks), GitHub Copilot CLI (preToolUse/postToolUse), Antigravity (Inspect hooks), Kiro (pre/post hooks), opencode (tool.execute.before/after), Goose (PreToolUse/PostToolUse engine), Cursor (six CLI events as of April 2026). The config differs per CLI, but each can ship a structured line per tool invocation to Loki. B17 is achievable across the accepted set; the presenter demonstrates it on Claude Code, and the repo can document the hook config for the others. No narrowing needed. (June 19, 2026)

## D12. Tempo over Jaeger; KEDA is not Karpenter

Tracing backend is Grafana Tempo, not Jaeger, to keep traces, logs, metrics, and dashboards under one Grafana pane. Jaeger is documented as an alternative path. KEDA (event-driven pod autoscaling) is a platform capability students learn; it is not a Karpenter substitute. Node provisioning is the fixed managed node group, and self-managed Karpenter is not used (see D9). (June 19, 2026)

## D15. RESOLVED: fleet provisioning is a shared lab VPC plus a per-cluster module

The student cluster shape is resolved by the end-to-end validation: one t3.2xlarge with VPC CNI prefix delegation and an explicit maxPods=110. Prefix delegation is required (the full platform needs ~75 pods; the default t3.2xlarge caps at 58), and it consumes ~112 IPs per node, which drives the network design.

The fleet is one shared lab VPC, not one VPC per cluster. A single `/16` with `/18` private subnets and one shared NAT gateway holds roughly 60 concurrent single-node clusters with headroom, instead of 60 VPCs and 60 NAT gateways. This is a lab network: isolation between students is in-cluster (NetworkPolicy), not at the VPC; we do not build production multi-tenancy. Provisioning is split into `scripts/provision/lab-vpc/` (applied once), a parameterized `scripts/provision/cluster/` module that takes `vpc_id` and `private_subnet_ids` (the validated shape, no VPC of its own), and `scripts/provision/fleet/fleet.sh`, which stamps out N clusters each with its own state file, concurrency-capped and parallel. Per-cluster state keeps the blast radius at one student. EKS owns the control-plane log group (`create_cloudwatch_log_group = false`) so reused names reprovision idempotently. Every resource is tagged `Workshop=packt` plus `Student=<name>`. The design ceiling is ~60 concurrent; for more, widen the subnets to `/17`. (June 21, 2026)

## D16. RESOLVED: workload identity is EKS Pod Identity, not IRSA

Every in-cluster workload that needs AWS permissions uses EKS Pod Identity. This covers both the AWS Load Balancer Controller and the EBS CSI driver. The cluster sets `enable_irsa = false`, so no OIDC provider is created.

Why: Pod Identity is the AWS-suggested default over IRSA as of 2026-07 (verified live against the official EKS EBS CSI docs; IRSA is still supported, not deprecated). At fleet scale IRSA would mean one OIDC provider plus a per-cluster trust policy for all 300 clusters; Pod Identity uses a reusable scoped role plus a simple per-cluster association. Being on the legacy path invites an avoidable "why not the modern default" ding on a repo students copy.

Wiring: the LB controller (a Helm chart deployed by ArgoCD) uses a standalone Pod Identity association (`module.aws_lb_controller_pod_identity`, `associations` populated). The EBS CSI driver (an EKS add-on) wires its association through the add-on's `pod_identity_association`, so `module.ebs_csi_pod_identity` creates role and policy only (`associations = {}`) and EKS owns the association ordering: no window where the controller starts without credentials. The `eks-pod-identity-agent` add-on is installed on every cluster. Terraform in `scripts/provision/cluster/main.tf`; validated (fmt, init, validate) and committed (7a49282).

Supersedes the earlier split ("EBS CSI via IRSA, Pod Identity for the LB controller") recorded in the build spec §6.3 and the cluster module comments before this date. (July 18, 2026)

## D16-validation. D16 proven on a live cluster (Pod Identity delivers working creds)

On 2026-07-18 a throwaway single-node cluster (`packt-podid-val`) was stood up from `scripts/provision/cluster/main.tf` on the shared lab VPC to prove D16 end to end, not just that the HCL validates. Results:

- No IAM OIDC provider was created in the account (`enable_irsa = false` holds): IRSA is off.
- The `eks-pod-identity-agent` add-on came up ACTIVE, and both associations exist: `kube-system/ebs-csi-controller-sa` and `kube-system/aws-load-balancer-controller`.
- Credential proof, EBS CSI: a pod running as `ebs-csi-controller-sa` called `sts get-caller-identity` and assumed `packt-podid-val-ebs-csi-*`. A `gp3` PVC (`ebs.csi.aws.com`) then bound in seconds; the consumer pod mounted the real EBS volume (`vol-05fad9f010caa7f93`), wrote, and read back. Provisioning an EBS volume requires `ec2:CreateVolume`, so this proves the add-on-native association gives the driver working credentials with EKS owning the ordering.
- Credential proof, LB controller: a pod running as the `aws-load-balancer-controller` SA assumed `packt-podid-val-aws-lbc-*` via the standalone association. The controller itself was not installed; the association delivers credentials to that SA regardless.

Teardown was clean: the CSI-provisioned EBS volume was deleted first (via PVC deletion) so it could not leak past `terraform destroy`, confirmed `available` then gone, then the cluster was destroyed (43 resources, destroy-only plan). D16 stands as written. (July 18, 2026)

## D17. RESOLVED: node root disk is 50 GB via block_device_mappings, not disk_size

The dev-cluster node group sized its root volume with `disk_size = 80`, which never took effect. terraform-aws-modules/eks manages a launch template for the node group by default, and `disk_size` is silently ignored whenever a launch template exists, so the node booted at the AL2023 AMI default of 20 GB. The image-heavy platform (the baked vLLM image alone is several GB) overflowed 20 GB, DiskPressure went True, and kubelet evicted the platform on a loop. This would have failed identically on every one of the 300 student clusters.

Fix: size the root volume through `block_device_mappings` (the launch-template path that actually applies), and set it to a measured value. On a live full-platform build the node rootfs used 34.4 GB, of which container images were 29.8 GB and pod writable layers were a few hundred MB. 50 GB is the resolved size: it holds ~35 GB used at ~69% of imagefs, which stays below kubelet's default 85% image-GC high threshold (so the baked vLLM image is never garbage-collected mid-workshop) and far above the 10% hard-eviction floor. 40 GB would sit at 86%, above the GC threshold, so sub-50 is unsafe; 80 and 100 were unjustified over-provisioning. `disk_size` is left out with a comment so it is not re-added. (July 19, 2026)

## D18. Manifest fixes found during the promo-demo build (v1alpha2 field, non-root UID)

Building the AI plane live on `adwc-dev` to film the promo clips surfaced three manifest defects that would have broken the workshop the same way:

- demo-agent ModelConfig used `spec.apiKeySecretRef`; the installed `kagent.dev/v1alpha2` ModelConfig CRD names the field `apiKeySecret` (verified against the cluster's CRD schema). Corrected in `platform/2-ai-plane/demo-agent/manifests/demo-agent.yaml`.
- vLLM (KServe `qwen3`) and llm-guard both set `runAsNonRoot: true` on images whose declared USER is non-numeric (vLLM base runs as root; llm-guard declares `user`), which kubelet refuses to start because it cannot verify non-root from a non-numeric user. Fixed by pinning an explicit numeric `runAsUser`: llm-guard to 1000 (matching the image's `user`, which owns the baked scanner-model cache), and vLLM to 1001 plus `HOME=/tmp` (writable cache) and `USER=vllm` (so torch's `getpass.getuser()` does not hit `pwd.getpwuid()` for a uid with no `/etc/passwd` entry).

These are committed manifest changes, not just live patches, so student clusters get the working versions. (July 19, 2026)

## D19. Repo made public; internal/ and prds/ scrubbed from history (July 19, 2026)

The platform tier's ArgoCD Applications all hardcode
`repoURL: https://github.com/peopleforrester/packt-agentic-devops.git`. While the repo
was private with no registered ArgoCD credential, every git-sourced Application failed
with `authentication required: Repository not found`, silently dark-firing every
student cluster's AI plane, Kyverno policies, and demo agent (Helm-sourced apps masked
it). Reading the two archived precedents this session settled the fix: both KCD Texas
(`KCD_Texas_2026_Workshop`) and Unleashed point their cluster ArgoCD at a PUBLIC GitHub
repo, anonymous read, zero per-cluster credentials. Neither gave a per-cluster writable
repo; Packt's in-cluster Gitea self-service tier is the writable piece both prior events
lacked. So the decision is: make this repo public, matching the proven model.

Before flipping public, `internal/` and `prds/` were scrubbed from all history with
git-filter-repo (`--path internal --path prds --invert-paths`), rewriting staging, main,
and the four `checkpoint/module-*` tags. Force-pushed with `--force-with-lease`. A fresh
anonymous clone including tags confirms 0 occurrences of either path across every ref.
The full-history security audit earlier this session found no real credentials ever
committed, so the scrub is a tidiness and surface-reduction choice, not a breach
response. Both directories are preserved on disk (untracked, gitignored) and backed up
(bundle + tarball in `~/repos/private/repo-backups/events/`). Residual GitHub-side:
force-orphaned objects remain reachable only by exact SHA until GitHub gc; a Support
request would purge them, not required for the stated concern.

Deferred to a pre-workshop "clean it public" pass: merge the verified manifest fixes to
main, switch the default branch to main, and add a student-facing README.

## D20. Foundation Kyverno policies ship in Audit, not Enforce (install first, enforce last)

The foundation `policy-baseline` ClusterPolicies (require-resource-limits,
restrict-image-registries, disallow-privileged, require-probes, require-labels) all set
`failureAction: Enforce`, while the AI-plane `ai-policies` set all ship `Audit`. That
split is the defect: an admission guardrail in Enforce mode rejects any pod that violates
it at admission time, including the pods of the very software the platform is still
installing. Kyverno enforcing a resource-limits or probe or registry invariant on the
`demo-apps` tenant namespace before the golden-path workload that satisfies it is deployed
denies that workload and stalls the build. This fails identically on every one of the 300
student clusters, where each student's Claude Code builds the platform live and cannot
proceed past a guardrail that blocks its own installs.

Fix: flip all five foundation rules to `failureAction: Audit`, matching the AI-plane set.
Audit reports violations to `PolicyReport`/`ClusterPolicyReport` without blocking
admission, so the whole platform lands governed but unblocked. Enforcement is turned on
only after the platform is healthy. The single sanctioned flip to Enforce during the
workshop is the B16/P16 governance demo on the AI-plane policies; the foundation baseline
stays Audit through the event (report-only is the correct posture for operational
best-practice rules a live-built platform is still converging toward). The install-first,
enforce-last principle is now a locked GitOps rule in the repo CLAUDE.md so a student's
Claude Code will not re-introduce an enforcing guardrail ahead of its backing workload.
This also closes a live/spec drift: the `adwc-dev` promo-build cluster already had these
policies patched to Audit live; the manifest now matches. (July 20, 2026)

## D21. The student terminal gets AWS access via EKS Pod Identity, not an IAM user and access key

The VTT previously received AWS credentials from a per-cluster IAM user whose access key
the provisioning script rotated on every run. That rotation was not a preference, it was
forced: AWS returns an access key's secret exactly once, so a script that cannot read an
existing key must delete and re-mint to obtain a usable pair. The consequences were a
non-idempotent provisioning step, a window where the key held by the running pod had just
been invalidated, an IAM propagation delay before a fresh key worked, and 250 users plus
250 keys to create and revoke across the fleet.

Pod Identity removes the credential entirely. The cluster already runs the
eks-pod-identity-agent addon, and terraform already uses this mechanism for the AWS Load
Balancer Controller and the EBS CSI driver, so this is the established pattern on the
cluster rather than a new one. Provisioning now creates a per-cluster role
`packt-student-<cluster>` scoped to `eks:DescribeCluster` on its own cluster ARN plus
`eks:ListClusters`, and a pod identity association on the `workshop/web-terminal`
ServiceAccount. The agent vends short-lived credentials at pod admission. Re-running the
script converges instead of rotating, nothing static exists to leak from the student's
shell, and deleting the cluster deletes the association. The script verifies the identity
by calling `sts:GetCallerIdentity` from inside the pod, because at fleet scale an
unverified provisioning step is 250 unverified steps.

Verified on adwc-dev: the terminal assumes `packt-student-adwc-dev`, `eks:DescribeCluster`
on its own cluster succeeds, and `ec2:DescribeInstances`, `iam:ListUsers`,
`s3:ListBuckets`, and describe against another cluster in the same account are all denied.

Known and accepted: the student is cluster-admin on their own cluster by design (the
workshop's task is to install a platform, which requires CRDs and ClusterRoles). Pod
Identity resolves credentials by (namespace, ServiceAccount), so a cluster-admin can
schedule a pod using the `aws-load-balancer-controller` ServiceAccount and receive that
role. This was confirmed empirically on adwc-dev. The student's effective AWS reach is
therefore the union of the Pod Identity roles present on their cluster, and tightening the
terminal's own role does not change that. What the union does NOT contain is the ability
to launch compute: no role on a student cluster holds `ec2:RunInstances` or `iam:PassRole`,
Karpenter is deliberately not deployed (see the build spec), and the managed node group is
a fixed shape. What it does contain is the load balancer controller policy's unconditional
`ec2:CreateSecurityGroup`, `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`,
`ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress`, and `elasticloadbalancing` listener and rule
create/delete/modify on `Resource: "*"`, which with roughly 50 clusters per account is an
account-wide reach. The containment boundary is the AWS account, not intra-cluster RBAC.
Node credentials are a lesser path: IMDS is already set to hop limit 1 with tokens
required, so only a hostNetwork pod reaches them, and the node role carries just the CNI,
ECR read, and worker node policies. (July 21, 2026)
